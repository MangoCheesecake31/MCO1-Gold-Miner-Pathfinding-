JUST IN CASE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Navigate to the src folder located inside the folder
2. Make sure you have JavaFX
	> Download Link: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

3. Edit the Batch Script "Compile & Run Driver with GUI.bat" file to see if you have the same JavaFX path. If not, change it to the location of your JavaFX lib.
	> Sample: set PATH_TO_FX="C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib"

4. Run the Batch Script "Compile & Run Driver with GUI.bat"


Notes:
	> It compiles everything using the JavaFX modules to the out folder and runs it here.
	> I only wrote this because I'm worried it won't run in your case. This is my method of compilation.
